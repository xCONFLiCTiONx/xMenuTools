## Language
xMenuTools is English only so if you want to use it and have a different language on your computer you should be able to install the English Language pack in Windows and it should run however you will likely have to set it as the default language due to using directory names as strings within the program.

## Recent changes:
* Added the latest version of [SharpShell](https://github.com/dwmkerr/sharpshell)
* Open with notepad: Uses the program set as default for opening .txt files.
* Added Windows Terminal to list of Command Lines in Directory Background
